# General Notes

-   Through this, I have realized that testing is important, and that writing better tests, tells you the next step you should take

# Future Feature

-   For the caesarCipher, I want to include an optional argument that changes the letter shift, and another function that decryps the message.
    -   I also want to create a UI.
